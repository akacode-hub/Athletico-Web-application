# Athletico-Web-application
Following is the web application using Python, Pymysql,Mongo db , Neo4js and Flask to manage the details of the athletes . The main aim of this database management project is to provide an easy platform for the recruiters &amp; scouts to access crucial information to discover new &amp; upcoming talent. 
Specialization case (Event, Team Match, Individual Competition): This tells the Event is the parent class and has two subclasses Team Match and Individual Competition as this helps us in keeping the record of the games played by teams on individual basis and with each other too. As this shows inheritance, hence the relation between them is specialization.
Referential and Transactional Data: Referential data is static data and transactional data is the data that keeps on changing. Hence the entities within tables Sports, Athlete, Team, Coach, Manager, Diet, Endorsement have the static data.
The transactional data lies in team matches and event tables where an athlete participates in matches where he/she belongs to a team and as the match is played the next match gets scheduled. This event can take place as a team match where the home team and away team id keeps on changing as soon as the match is played.
